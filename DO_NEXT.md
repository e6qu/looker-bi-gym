# Do Next

## Immediate Next Step

Numbered tasks 001 through 019 are complete locally.

Next implementation step:

- Start [020 - Step-By-Step Tutorial Rewrite](tasks/020-step-by-step-tutorial-rewrite.md): replace the released tutorial outlines with explicit actions, expected checkpoints, common failure modes, and source fact IDs from [docs/facts/README.md](docs/facts/README.md).

Preservation and verification steps:

- If a Safari pass is required before release, ask the user to explicitly enable Safari "Allow remote automation" or perform the manual Safari QA checklist in `docs/10-app-quality-browser-qa.md`.
- Keep rebuildable generated outputs ignored; regenerate them from committed source instead of committing them.
- Keep DuckDB-WASM runtime files supplied by dependencies/local build output, not committed binary artifacts.
- Keep config files in `app/configs/` as TypeScript and covered by `tsconfig.node.json`.
- Keep `bun run format:check`, `bun run lint`, `bun run typecheck`, and `bun run check` clean before merging.
- Preserve the frontend-only boundary: no backend calls, server session, API database, analytics beacon, or learner-data upload.
- Preserve browser-local progress behavior: `localStorage` plus same-site cookie fallback, with reset clearing both.
- Preserve the test pyramid documented in `docs/12-test-pyramid.md` and enforced by `bun run test:platform-boundary`.
- Preserve the Task 015 fixture coverage rule: every released manifest needs a known-good solution fixture or a documented exception, and CTF/trap challenges need expected known-bad coverage.
- Preserve the Task 016 export boundary: progress export must stay local, user-controlled, and free of credentials, raw answers, pasted cloud evidence, sensitive synthetic field names, real banking data, storage keys, and hidden app internals.
- Preserve the Task 017 content QA boundary: `bun run test:content-qa` must keep required tools, regulatory-context links, disclaimer language, synthetic-data warnings, dataset synthetic-only notes, and internal Markdown links covered.
- Preserve the rendered UI boundary: `bun run test:e2e` must keep the real built app, responsive layout, challenge pages, DuckDB-WASM SQL execution, cloud-evidence controls, Settings export metadata, and overflow checks covered.
- Preserve the Task 018 release boundary: `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSIONING.md`, app/content version display, challenge versions, fixture tests, content QA, rendered UI tests, and generated-artifact review must stay aligned.
- Preserve the Task 019 fact-backed instruction boundary: source facts belong in `docs/facts/README.md`, and future regulation/product/browser-storage/BI-tooling questions should cite fact IDs.
