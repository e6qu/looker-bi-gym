# Do Next

## Immediate Next Step

Numbered implementation tasks 001 through 028 are implemented. PR #3 through
PR #11 were merged. PR #11 merged on 2026-05-10 at merge commit
`bd0be4505958f2e33706169dc7816096c7abc617`.

Current implementation step:

- PR #11 (`https://github.com/e6qu/looker-bi-gym/pull/11`) is merged and
  post-merge verified.
- Main CI run `25629510931` passed for merge commit
  `bd0be4505958f2e33706169dc7816096c7abc617`.
- Main GitHub Pages deployment run `25629510924` passed for the same merge
  commit, and `https://e6qu.github.io/looker-bi-gym/` returned HTTP 200.
- Current branch: `ci-ui-warning-checks`.
- Current branch purpose: strengthen CI and UI warning/error detection by
  adding explicit CI steps for format, derived SQL expectations, browser-config,
  fact database, LLM workbench, and platform-boundary checks; make
  `bun run check` include `format:check`; and make rendered Playwright tests
  fail on browser console warnings/errors, page errors, and failed network
  requests.
- Read `README.md`, `docs/14-platform-components.md`, `PLAN.md`, `STATUS.md`,
  `BUGS.md`, `tasks/025-real-tutorial-instruction-packs.md`, and
  `tasks/026-challenge-grading-contract-expansion.md` first.
- Keep terminology precise: `implementation tasks` are numbered repo work items
  under `tasks/*.md`; `learner tasks` are curriculum exercise units shown to
  learners.

1. Commit and open a PR for branch `ci-ui-warning-checks`.
2. Let GitHub Actions run; do not merge. The user will merge after CI is done.
3. After that PR is merged, verify main CI, GitHub Pages deployment, and the
   live GitHub Pages app again.
4. Good next implementation candidates after this hardening PR are a
   browser-local JSON import flow for Settings, richer browser-config or
   metric-contract challenges, or rendering quiz/exam YAML directly in the app
   instead of maintaining separate learner-facing Markdown summaries.
5. Keep ignored screenshot artifacts local only; do not commit them.

Preservation and verification steps:

- If a Safari pass is required before release, ask the user to explicitly enable Safari "Allow remote automation" or perform the manual Safari QA checklist in `docs/10-app-quality-browser-qa.md`.
- Keep rebuildable generated outputs ignored; regenerate them from committed source instead of committing them.
- Keep DuckDB-WASM runtime files supplied by dependencies/local build output, not committed binary artifacts.
- Keep config files in `app/configs/` as TypeScript and covered by `tsconfig.node.json`.
- Keep `bun run format:check`, `bun run lint`, `bun run typecheck`, and `bun run check` clean before merging. Full `bun run check` passed locally for the `ci-ui-warning-checks` branch on 2026-05-10 after rerunning with local Vite preview port binding allowed for Playwright.
- Preserve the frontend-only boundary: no backend calls, server session, API database, analytics beacon, or learner-data upload.
- Preserve browser-local progress behavior: `localStorage` plus same-site cookie fallback, with reset clearing both.
- Preserve Settings export behavior and implement future import as browser-local JSON validation/preview/apply only.
- Preserve the test pyramid documented in `docs/12-test-pyramid.md` and enforced by `bun run test:platform-boundary`.
- Preserve the Task 015 fixture coverage rule: every released manifest needs a known-good solution fixture or a documented exception, and CTF/trap challenges need expected known-bad coverage.
- Preserve the Task 026 grading-contract rule: browser-config challenges use
  local JSON evidence only, supported checks must be covered by content QA, and
  exclusion-style artifact checks need known-bad fixture coverage. Browser-SQL
  exact row-count and aggregate manifest expectations must stay covered by
  `bun run test:derived-expectations`.
- Preserve the Task 016 export boundary: progress export must stay local, user-controlled, and free of credentials, raw answers, pasted cloud evidence, sensitive synthetic field names, real banking data, storage keys, and hidden app internals.
- Preserve the Task 017 content QA boundary: `bun run test:content-qa` must keep required tools, regulatory-context links, disclaimer language, synthetic-data warnings, dataset synthetic-only notes, and internal Markdown links covered.
- Preserve the rendered UI boundary: `bun run test:e2e` must keep the real built app, responsive layout, challenge pages, DuckDB-WASM SQL execution, cloud-evidence controls, Settings export metadata, overflow checks, and browser diagnostics checks for warnings/errors/page failures/failed requests covered.
- Preserve the Task 018 release boundary: `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSIONING.md`, app/content version display, challenge versions, fixture tests, content QA, rendered UI tests, and generated-artifact review must stay aligned.
- Preserve the Task 019 fact-backed instruction boundary: source facts belong in `docs/facts/README.md`, and future regulation/product/browser-storage/BI-tooling questions should cite fact IDs.
- Preserve the Task 020-022 instruction boundary: released manifests need rendered `lesson_steps`; released questions and steps need known `source_facts`; released tutorial Markdown needs Source Facts, Steps, Checkpoints, and Common Failure Modes sections.
- Preserve the post-merge tutorial objective boundary: tutorial-like pages should put `Objective:` and an "After this tutorial/task/recipe/page, you will be able to:" block near the top so learners know what skill they are practicing.
- Preserve the flashcards planning boundary: Task 029 is future scope only until
  explicitly prioritized. Do not implement flashcard UI, scheduler, deck schema,
  or flashcard import/export in the PR #11 post-merge cleanup.
- Preserve the Task 027 fact corpus boundary: learner facts should be banking BI, BigQuery, Looker Studio, and official regulatory/banking facts, not app implementation facts.
- Preserve downloaded Google Cloud documentation snapshots under `sources/platforms/*/full/` as sanitized article-only Markdown wrappers with attribution.
- Preserve `bun run test:facts-db` in the check pyramid so fact-source links, fact cross-links, and source snapshots stay queryable through SQLite.
- Preserve the manual-only LLM workbench boundary: `var/llm-workbench/` stays
  ignored, generated/reviewed questions are draft-only, and dreaming stays
  manual through `make dream`, `make dream-codex`, or `make dream-claude` unless
  a future task explicitly designs scheduler controls.

## Upcoming Tasks

- [024 - Deterministic Local Dataset Packs](tasks/024-deterministic-local-dataset-packs.md)
- [025 - Real Tutorial Instruction Packs](tasks/025-real-tutorial-instruction-packs.md)
- [026 - Challenge Grading Contract Expansion](tasks/026-challenge-grading-contract-expansion.md)
- [028 - Platform Component Organization](tasks/028-platform-component-organization.md)
- Use the SQLite fact database to draft richer fact-backed questions and tutorial steps.
