# Bugs

No known app bugs after the Bun-only tooling, typed config, formatting, rendered UI, and automated check passes.

## Follow-Up Verification Gaps

- Track Vite/DuckDB-WASM source-map noise during browser verification. It did not fail Task 008, but the dev server logged many DuckDB worker source-map warnings from package internals.
- Complete Safari second-browser verification for Task 013. `safaridriver` is installed with Safari 26.1, but Safari's persistent "Allow remote automation" setting is disabled. Enabling it requires explicit user authorization because it changes a persistent browser security setting. The manual checklist lives in `docs/10-app-quality-browser-qa.md`.
